    <h1>OpenNewPOS6</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the OpenNewPOS6 project! This initiative is a creative endeavor to replicate the look and feel of the NP# POS system used by McDonald's Australia. It's important to note that this project is purely for educational and entertainment purposes and does not intend to infringe on any copyrights.

        The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring that the emulation is as close to the original as possible. While the current version focuses on the visual aspects of the POS system, contributions towards adding functionality are welcome. If you're interested in contributing, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.</p>
